      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi everyone! I'm almost 22 at the time of this writing (12/22/20). I have never stepped this deep into the land of coding, so many things are new to me. I probably won't be a master hacker when I'm done, but at least I'll have a new skill under my belt.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Rockville, Maryland, but I consider Brooklyn Park, Minnesota home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I greatly enjoy PC videogames and anime, as well as drawing, listening to music, and taking walks. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy working with people in need, so anything involving patient care in that aspect (such as direct patient care or nursing) appeals to me. I also enjoy traveling--a dream life would be having a "home base" of sorts in a nice area, then flying to various other places. It seems somewhat impractical in the long term, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Brooklyn Park, MN</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In an increasingly digitalized world, people are relying on websites and computers more than ever before. Having the skill set of web development will be beneficial to any future endeavours I may encounter.  </p>
